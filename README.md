# Regularization



**Avoid Overfitting Using Regularization in TensorFlow** : Developed an understanding on how to avoid over-fitting with weight regularization and dropout regularization. Applied both weight regularization and dropout regularization in Keras with TensorFlow backend.

**Save, Load and Export Models with Keras**: Saved, load and exported models with Keras.
